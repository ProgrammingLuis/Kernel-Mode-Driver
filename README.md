<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

I have always wondered how emulators worked and making my own is my way of learning about them. 

Things I have learned about while working on this project:
* Kernel-mode vs User-mode.
* Operating Systems (Windows 10)
* How memory works
* How to debug drivers

I hope to develop more software drivers in the future. Currently, I am getting some BSODS, but I will fix them. Please let me know about any bugs/issues so that I can get better at this.

A list of commonly used resources that I found helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.

### Built With
This was all done in Community Visual Studio 2019. 
* C
* WDF (Windows Driver Frameworks)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

For now, the driver finds a process and gets a handle to it.

### Prerequisites

To run this program you will need to compile the files in Visual Studio.
* Visual Studio

### Installation
```sh
Visual C
* To build this project in Visual C you will need the Windows Drivers extension, after that download structs.h and Driver.c, then build and run the program.
* To run the program you will have to launch the driver with Driver Signature Enforcement disabled.
```

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

When finished, the program will be able to read and write virtual memory to a desired process.

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

See the [open issues](https://github.com/ProgrammingLuis/Intel8080/issues) for a list of proposed features (and known issues).
